1. how to use the imports in a component
   -  react default imports like `import react,{useState} from "react"` or `import axios from axios` and add a space
   -  now add custom imports like hooks,components, functions you created and add a space
   -  now add styles imports and add a space

2. Never use bootstrap , 
   - we are using vanilla CSS ,and  we use only that now
