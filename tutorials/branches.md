# Rules for Using Branches For Developers

1. Once a new branch has been created in the repo developers have to fetch it using : git fetch <link> <remote_branch_name>
2. Developers while committing will only commit directly to development branch.
3. No developer should merge, commit to Staging, Main
4. Avoid pushing code using git push <link> use git push <link> development
