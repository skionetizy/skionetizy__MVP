1. Performance – this laptop is a monster. With the Intel core i5 -at its core and NVidia Grpahics is making the gaming experience wonderful ,laptop can sustain 60FPS on most games at high settings.

2. The best part about the laptop is the dual storage. The 128GB SSD really speeds things up. Boot up is bolt and flashing (less than 10 secs). Game load times are much faster

3. , Overwatch, CS & Dota. Everything ran butter smooth I was agreeably shocked by the thermal performance. The fans turned on, but they are not so much loud. There was no throttling whatsoever. I also work on Premier pro and Adobe Photoshop ,it works remarkably well.

The looks -. It resembles a brushed metal surface and bonus Legion logo. Even though it is a gaming laptop, The build quality is excellent and looks premium.

The display The HD display is beautiful and lucid. Overall, I love the display. Display is the best part of Lenovo Legion

Overall

Inspite of the battery problem, I however believe this is one of the best gaming/performance laptops out there in this price range. I adore the thought to small details like having all the ports at the back to guarantee that your desk does not look cluttered, to a 180-degree pivot, which assures you do not accidentally damage your hinge. Harman speakers is as great , as you can expect the best sound quality in a laptop.. If you are someone who is looking for a budget and performing laptop in the market, you should definitely consider checking it out
